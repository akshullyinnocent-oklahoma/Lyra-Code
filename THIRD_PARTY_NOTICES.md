## Test-Only Dependencies

| JUnit | Eclipse Public License 1.0 | Test dependency. |
| AndroidX Test / Espresso | Apache License 2.0 | Android instrumentation tests. |

## Compliance Notes

- Apache License 2.0 dependencies can generally be combined into GPLv3/AGPLv3 works, but keep required notices and license texts.
- The local JLaTeXMath module is the main copyleft-sensitive component. Its local `LICENSE` says it is GPL v2 or later and includes a special linking exception for independent modules. If you modify that library, preserve its license terms and review whether the exception still applies.
- Commercial licensing of Lyra Code original code does not relicense third-party components. Commercial distributors must still comply with third-party licenses or replace those components with separately licensed alternatives.
